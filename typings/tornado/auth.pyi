"""This module contains implementations of various third-party
authentication schemes.

All the classes in this file are class mixins designed to be used with
the `tornado.web.RequestHandler` class.  They are used in two ways:

* On a login handler, use methods such as ``authenticate_redirect()``,
  ``authorize_redirect()``, and ``get_authenticated_user()`` to
  establish the user's identity and store authentication tokens to your
  database and/or cookies.
* In non-login handlers, use methods such as ``facebook_request()``
  or ``twitter_request()`` to use the authentication tokens to make
  requests to the respective services.

They all take slightly different arguments due to the fact all these
services implement authentication and authorization slightly differently.
See the individual service classes below for complete documentation.

Example usage for Google OAuth:

.. testcode::

    class GoogleOAuth2LoginHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler,
                                   tornado.auth.GoogleOAuth2Mixin):
        async def get(self):
            if self.get_argument('code', False):
                user = await self.get_authenticated_user(
                    redirect_uri='http://your.site.com/auth/google',
                    code=self.get_argument('code'))
                # Save the user with e.g. set_secure_cookie

.. versionchanged:: 4.0
   All of the callback interfaces in this module are now guaranteed
   to run their callback with an argument of ``None`` on error.
   Previously some functions would do this while others would simply
   terminate the request on their own.  This change also ensures that
   errors are more consistently reported through the ``Future`` interfaces.

        """Fetches the given relative API path, e.g., "/btaylor/picture"

        If the request is a POST, ``post_args`` should be provided. Query

        An introduction to the Facebook Graph API can be found at

        Many methods require an OAuth access token which you can
        obtain through `~OAuth2Mixin.authorize_redirect` and
        `get_authenticated_user`. The user returned through that
        process includes an ``access_token`` attribute that can be
        used to make authenticated requests via this method.

        Example usage:

        .. testcode::

            class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler,
                              tornado.auth.FacebookGraphMixin):
                @tornado.web.authenticated
                async def get(self):
                    new_entry = await self.facebook_request(
                        "/me/feed",
                        post_args={"message": "I am posting from my Tornado application!"},
                        access_token=self.current_user["access_token"])

                    if not new_entry:
                        # Call failed; perhaps missing permission?
                        yield self.authorize_redirect()
                        return
                    self.finish("Posted a message!")

        .. testoutput::
           :hide:

        The given path is relative to ``self._FACEBOOK_BASE_URL``,
        by default "https://graph.facebook.com".

        This method is a wrapper around `OAuth2Mixin.oauth2_request`;
        the only difference is that this method takes a relative path,
        while ``oauth2_request`` takes a complete url.

        .. versionchanged:: 3.1
           Added the ability to override ``self._FACEBOOK_BASE_URL``.

        .. deprecated:: 5.1

           The ``callback`` argument is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0.
           Use the returned awaitable object instead.
